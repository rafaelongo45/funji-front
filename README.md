The objective of this project is to help users learn kanjis! It's possible to look for other registered users and take a look at their progress. You can save a kanji to your profile and review its kun'yomi reading, on'yomi reading or translation! This project uses an API that has data for a lot of kanjis (kanjiapi - link in next section). Kanjis are separated by grades.

# This project uses the kanjiapi
